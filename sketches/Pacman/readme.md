# Pacman Game on Arduino Uno & LCDKeypadShield

## Overview
This is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic **Pacman Game**, designed to run on an **Arduino Uno** with an **LCD Keypad Shield**. The game is fully interactive, featuring movement controls, collectible dots, and a pursuing ghost.

### How It Works:
- **Objective**: Guide Pacman to eat all the dots on the screen while avoiding the ghost.
- **Game Controls**: Use the LCD Keypad Shield buttons to navigate Pacman:
  - **Left**: Move left
  - **Right**: Move right
  - **Up**: Move up
  - **Down**: Move down
- **Progression**:
  - If you eat all the dots, you advance to the next level with increased difficulty.
  - If the ghost catches Pacman, the game is over.

## Features
- **LCD Display**:
  - Displays the game grid.
  - Shows Pacman, the ghost, and dots.
- **Sound Effects**:
  - A buzzer provides feedback for eating dots, ghost encounters, and other events.
- **Dynamic Levels**:
  - Each level gets progressively harder as the ghost speeds up.
- **Custom Characters**:
  - Pacman, the ghost, and dots are rendered using custom LCD characters.
