# Hangman Game for Arduino LCD Keypad Shield

This project implements the classic **Hangman** game on an Arduino using the **LCD Keypad Shield**. The game allows players to guess a word by suggesting letters, with the classic "hangman" mechanic used for wrong guesses.

## Features:
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Use the buttons on the LCD Keypad Shield to make guesses.
- **Easy to Play**: Display feedback directly on the screen with the current word and hangman image.
- **Compact Code**: Optimized for small memory footprint on Arduino boards.

## Hardware Requirements:
- Arduino board (such as Arduino Uno, Nano, etc.)
- LCD Keypad Shield

## Software Requirements:
- Arduino IDE
- LCD Keypad Shield library
- A compatible LCD display (16x2 or similar)

## How to Use:
1. **Upload the Code**: Upload the `Hangman.ino` sketch to your Arduino board.
2. **Connect the LCD Keypad Shield**: Attach the LCD Keypad Shield to your Arduino.
3. **Start Playing**: Use the keypad buttons to guess letters for the hidden word. The game will display feedback and a visual hangman as you play.
