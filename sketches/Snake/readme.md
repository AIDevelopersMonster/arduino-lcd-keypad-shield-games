# Snake Game for Arduino (LCD Keypad Shield)

This is a simple implementation of the classic "Snake" game for Arduino, using an LCD screen and a keypad shield. In this game, the player controls a snake that eats food to grow in length while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body.

---

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: The snake moves around the screen, collecting food and growing longer.
- **LCD Display**: The game uses a 16x2 LCD display to show the snake, food, and game status.
- **Levels**: The game includes multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Snake Growth**: Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length and the speed increases.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays "Game Over" and your score when the snake collides with walls or itself.

---

## Components Used

- **Arduino Uno**: The main controller for running the game logic.
- **LCD Keypad Shield**: For displaying the game and controlling the snake.
- **Buttons**: The 5-way joystick (on the LCD Keypad Shield) is used to control the direction of the snake.

---

## How It Works

1. **Snake Movement**: The snake is controlled using four buttons (up, down, left, right) connected to the Arduino.
2. **Food Generation**: The snake collects randomly generated food items that appear on the screen.
3. **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls of the game area.
4. **Levels**: The game includes multiple levels, each with different wall patterns that the player must avoid.
5. **Growing Snake**: Every time the snake eats food, it grows longer and the speed increases.

## Game Controls

- **Up**: Move the snake up.
- **Down**: Move the snake down.
- **Left**: Move the snake left.
- **Right**: Move the snake right.
- **Select**: Start the game or change the level.

---

## Installation

1. **Connect the Hardware**:
   - Use an Arduino Uno (or compatible board).
   - Connect an LCD Keypad Shield to the Arduino.
   
2. **Install the LCD Library**:
   If you haven't already, install the [LiquidCrystal library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal) in the Arduino IDE.

3. **Upload the Code**:
   Download the `Snake_Game.ino` file and upload it to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

## Code Overview

### Key Variables and Structures

- **mySnake[8][8]**: Custom characters representing the snake.
- **levelz[5][2][16]**: Array defining wall patterns for each level.
- **partdef**: Structure representing each part of the snake.
- **head** and **tail**: Pointers to the snake's head and tail.

### Functions

- **drawMatrix()**: Displays the game matrix on the LCD.
- **moveHead()**: Moves the head of the snake based on the current direction.
- **moveAll()**: Moves the entire snake, including the body parts.
- **growSnake()**: Adds a new part to the snake when it eats food.
- **gameOverFunction()**: Displays the "Game Over" screen and shows the score.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the game to fit your needs:

- **Adjust the game speed** by changing the `gameSpeed` variable.
- **Modify the levels** by editing the `levelz` array to create new wall patterns.
- **Customize the snake graphics** by changing the `mySnake` array.
