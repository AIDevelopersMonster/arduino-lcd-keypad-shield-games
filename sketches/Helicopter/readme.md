# Helicopter Game for Arduino LCD

This project is an adaptation of the classic "Helicopter" game for Arduino, using an LCD display and a speaker for sound effects. The original game was created by [Kevin Loney](https://makezine.com/2013/03/11/arduino-helicopter-game-2/) and is available under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

In this version, we made several improvements, including:

- **Character Animation**: Custom animations for the helicopter's tail.
- **Button Control**: Button input is read using a resistive voltage divider, making it easier to connect buttons.
- **Sound Effects**: Musical and sound effects have been added, including sounds when the game starts, when the player wins, and when a collision occurs.
- **High Score Saving**: High scores are saved to EEPROM and displayed on the screen.
- **LCD Customization**: Custom characters are used for sprites, walls, and explosions.

## Features

- **Smooth Animation**: The helicopter tail animates with custom sprites on the LCD screen.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game's difficulty increases over time as the obstacles speed up.
- **Sound Effects**: The game features a dynamic soundtrack with tones for various events, including collision detection.
- **Highscore Storage**: High scores are stored in EEPROM and persist after powering down the Arduino.

## Video

Hereâ€™s a video demonstration of the game:
