# Tromino Game for Arduino

## Description

**Tromino Game** is a fun and challenging puzzle game designed for Arduino using the **LCD Keypad Shield**. The goal of the game is to arrange the pieces of a tromino (a tile that covers exactly three squares) on the grid in such a way that they fit perfectly and cover all the squares. The game increases in difficulty as the grid grows larger, providing a great challenge for puzzle enthusiasts!

This project features a simple yet engaging gameplay loop with interactive controls and a visual grid display on the LCD screen. The player needs to think strategically about how to rotate and place the tromino pieces.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid:** The grid size increases as you progress, making the puzzle more challenging.
- **Tromino Pieces:** The player must arrange pieces (L-shaped tiles) to fit perfectly into the grid.
- **Simple Controls:** Use the buttons on the LCD Keypad Shield to rotate and place pieces.
- **Game Restart:** After completing or failing to complete the puzzle, restart the game with a new challenge.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game** by pressing any button on the LCD Keypad Shield.
2. **Rotate the Tromino Pieces** using the available controls:
   - `UP`: Rotate the tromino piece clockwise.
   - `DOWN`: Rotate the tromino piece counterclockwise.
   - `LEFT` and `RIGHT`: Move the piece to the desired position.
3. **Place the Piece** into the grid when it's in the correct position.
4. **Complete the Puzzle** by filling all the grid squares without overlapping pieces.
5. **Game Over:** If you canâ€™t fit the pieces correctly or run out of space, the game ends.
6. **Restart the Game** by pressing a button after the game over screen.
