🔧 What You Need
Hardware
Arduino Uno (or compatible)
LCD Keypad Shield (compatible with Arduino)
Piezo Buzzer for sound effects
Jumper Wires (if additional connections are needed)
Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
Resistors (if required for your specific setup)
Software
Arduino IDE (latest version recommended)
LiquidCrystal Library (usually included with Arduino IDE)
💡 Features
Intuitive Controls: Use the built-in buttons on the LCD Keypad Shield to move your car up and down the lanes.
Sound Effects: Engage with realistic sound effects via the piezo buzzer.
Increasing Difficulty: The game speed gradually increases, providing a challenging experience.
Collision Detection: If you collide with a truck, the game ends and displays your survival time.
Simple Graphics: Clear and straightforward visuals on the 16x2 LCD display.
📜 Code Overview
The TruckLane project leverages the LiquidCrystal library to control the LCD display. The game generates random positions for oncoming trucks, which move towards the player's car. Use the keypad buttons to navigate your car and avoid collisions. Upon crashing, the game displays the duration you survived and emits a crash sound.

Key Components of the Code
LCD Initialization: Sets up the LCD display with custom characters representing the car, trucks, and crash indicators.
Input Handling: Reads button presses from the LCD Keypad Shield to move the car.
Game Logic: Manages truck positions, collision detection, and game speed.
Sound Effects: Uses the piezo buzzer to provide audio feedback during crashes.
