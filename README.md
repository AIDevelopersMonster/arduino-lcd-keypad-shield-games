### Description
![Number Flip-Flop](images/REV01.png?raw=true "Number Flip-Flop")
Look at the number in the photo. It might not be obvious at first, but notice that we have a string of all ten digits from 0 to 9 in a scrambled order.
The object of the game is to put the numbers into proper order. You do that by flipping the order for the left hand side of the string. Watch how we might do this.
In the text below, I will highlight the digits that I want to flip. You will see that their order will be reversed in the next iteration.
